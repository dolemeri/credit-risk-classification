# UofT - Data Analysis Boot Camp

### Module 20 Supervised Learning (Supervised Machine Learning)

### Credit Risk Classification Analysis

### Overview

In this challenge, various supervised learning techniques were used to train and evaluate a model centered on assessing loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Languages/ Tools:

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

The data was loaded into a DataFrame and the "loan_status" column was designated as the target variable (`y`). The remaining columns were assigned as the features (`X`)

The data was split into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.

## Create a Logistic Regression Model

A logistic regression model was initialized and fitted using the training data.

Predictions on the testing data labels were generated by employing the testing feature data and the fitted model.

The model's performance was then evaluated by calculating the accuracy score and generating a confusion matrix and a classification report.
